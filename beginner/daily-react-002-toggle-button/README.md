# Toggle Button

**The challenge:**
Create a button that toggles between two states — for example, “ON”/“OFF” or “Show”/“Hide”.

## Core Concepts:

- Boolean state management with useState.
- Conditional rendering and styling based on state.
- Simple UI state logic.

## Additional Steps

- Use CSS transitions for smooth state changes.
- AAllow keyboard accessibility with Enter or Space.
- Abstract toggle logic into a custom hook (useToggle).


## Approach

Another challenge focusing on the use of useState hook, conditional rendering and this time adding styling based on state.


I started by building a functional version of the toggle button, then iteratively improved the code by:

- Simplifying conditional logic in the handler function

- Adding conditional rendering and styling based on the state

- Improving styles with keyframe animations and transitions



## Final thoughts

While straightforward, this project effectively demonstrates core React concepts like state management and event handling, as well as conditional rendering and styling based on state and state changes.
The challenge today was creating the custom hook for the useToggle.
