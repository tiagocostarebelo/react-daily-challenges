# Colox Box Generator

**The challenge:**
Create a tool where users input a color (e.g., hex or text) and render a box displaying that color.

## Core Concepts:

- Dynamic inline styling in React.
- HMapping user input to visual output.

## Additional Steps

- Generate random colors.
- Store color history and allow selection.
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- Include a RGB display with the HEX code converted


## Approach

Working with State again, but this time, the challenge was to dynamically use state in the inline styling, to map it and display the color box.



## Final thoughts
