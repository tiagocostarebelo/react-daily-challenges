# React Challenges

A personal collection of **React.js challenges** completed daily (or weekly) to sharpen my frontend development skills.  
Each challenge focuses on strengthening core React concepts — from components and props to hooks, state management, and performance optimization.

This repository is both a **learning log** and a **progress showcase**, documenting my growth as a React developer.

## Purpose

- Build strong **React fundamentals** through hands-on challenges.  
- Practice writing **clean, modular, and reusable components**.  
- Learn **React best practices** while exploring real-world use cases.  
- Document each challenge with explanations, key takeaways, and improvements.  
- Keep a consistent **public learning record** on GitHub and LinkedIn.

Each challenge includes:

- **Challenge Description** – What it’s about and what it tests.  
- **Approach** – How I planned and structured the solution.  
- **Code Explanation** – Key React concepts involved.  
- **Possible Enhancements** – Ideas for scaling or improving the component.
